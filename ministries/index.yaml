      At Gateway Kids, we are passionate about training up the next generation
      to lead, love, and serve Jesus! We strive to come alongside parents to
      help them disciple their children at home while we point them to Jesus
      while they are here.


      Through the reading of Godâ€™s Word, worship, games, and crafts, your child
      will hear the gospel every Sunday. It is our desire for them to start to
      understand the good news of Jesus from a young age! 


      We take the safety of our kids seriously! All of our members serving in
      Gateway Kids have gone through a background check and Ministry Safe
      Training. We would love for you to arrive early to get them checked in,
      check out their classroom, and meet their teachers!
