  - title: Expository Preaching
    description: >-
      We believe that “faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of
      Christ” (Rom. 10:17). That’s why the focal point of our Sunday gathering
      is hearing the Bible preached. Expository preaching means we make our way
      through the Bible verse by verse, chapter by chapter.
  - title: Congregational Singing
    description: >-
      On Sundays, we come together to confess our faith and worship the Lord
      together in singing.
  - title: Corporate Prayer
    description: >-
      We take time on Sundays to bring our needs before God, asking Him to stir
      our hearts and renew our minds. We also confess our sins together and ask
      Him to heal us and make us more like Jesus.
