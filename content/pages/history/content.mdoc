In the Fall of 1943, the small town of Gilbert hosted a series of revival services put on by First Baptist Church of Chandler. After the final service a group of people met with the sole purpose of planting a Southern Baptist church in downtown Gilbert. That day our church, known at that time as First Baptist Church of Gilbert, was born.

Just 5 years into our existence, the Lord opened up an opportunity for us to purchase property and build facilities on the cross streets of Main and Vaughn. This would be our home for the next 50 years, until booming growth would force us to look east for a space that could help sustain the growth the Lord was bringing.

In 1999, we moved into our current space on the cross streets of Recker and Elliot, and changed our name to Gateway Fellowship SBC. Over the last 25 years the Lord has used Gateway as a place for Christians to grow in their knowledge of Scripture and be equipped for every good work that He has prepared for us.

Today, Gateway Fellowship is committed to its original mission - to make disciples of all the nations. We desire to reach people in Gilbert and across the globe with the gospel of Jesus Christ and disciple them in the context of a local church. It is our prayer and aim to revitalize and plant churches by equipping and sending out pastor-qualified men with a team of faithful church members to do this work.

We pray that the Lord would see fit to use us to send out 20 pastors to plant healthy churches or revitalize other churches before our 100 year anniversary in 2043.
