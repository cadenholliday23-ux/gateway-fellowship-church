  - title: The Trinity
    description: >-
      We believe that God is one being that exists in three distinct persons:
      the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three persons are equal in
      power, glory, and majesty, and each has the same divine nature. However,
      they are not identical, and their differences are found in how they relate
      to each other and the roles they play in accomplishing their common
      purpose.
  - title: Jesus Christ
    description: >-
      We believe that Christ is one person with both a human and divine nature,
      and that he became human in order to save people.
  - title: Salvation by Grace
    description: >-
      We believe that salvation is by grace alone which means that God loves,
      forgives, and saves us not because of who we are or what we do, but
      because of the work of Christ. Our best efforts can never be good enough
      to earn salvation, but God declares us righteous for Christ's sake.
  - title: Scripture
    description: >-
      We believe that the Bible is inerrant, meaning it is without error or
      fault in all its teachings. This belief is based on the idea that the
      Bible's authors, the prophets and apostles, were guided by the Holy Spirit
      and could not err when writing Scripture. As a result, the Bible's
      original manuscripts contain no affirmations that contradict fact, and
      everything in the Bible is true because it comes from God.
  - title: Sin
    description: >-
      We believe all people are, as a result of the fall, not inclined or even
      able to love God wholly with heart, mind, and strength, but rather are
      inclined by nature to serve their own will and desires and reject his
      rule.
