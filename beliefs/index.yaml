  - title: The Scriptures
    description: >-
      The Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is God’s
      revelation of Himself to man. It is a perfect treasure of divine
      instruction. It has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth,
      without any mixture of error, for its matter. Therefore, all Scripture is
      totally true and trustworthy. It reveals the principles by which God
      judges us, and therefore is, and will remain to the end of the world, the
      true center of Christian union, and the supreme standard by which all
      human conduct, creeds, and religious opinions should be tried. All
      Scripture is a testimony to Christ, who is Himself the focus of divine
      revelation.
  - title: God
    description: >-
      There is one and only one living and true God. He is an intelligent,
      spiritual, and personal Being, the Creator, Redeemer, Preserver, and Ruler
      of the universe. God is infinite in holiness and all other perfections.
      God is all powerful and all knowing; and His perfect knowledge extends to
      all things, past, present, and future, including the future decisions of
      His free creatures. To Him we owe the highest love, reverence, and
      obedience. The eternal triune God reveals Himself to us as Father, Son,
      and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, but without division
      of nature, essence, or being.
  - title: God the Father
    description: >-
      God as Father reigns with providential care over His universe, His
      creatures, and the flow of the stream of human history according to the
      purposes of His grace. He is all powerful, all knowing, all loving, and
      all wise. God is Father in truth to those who become children of God
      through faith in Jesus Christ. He is fatherly in His attitude toward all
      men.
  - title: God the Son
    description: >-
      Christ is the eternal Son of God. In His incarnation as Jesus Christ He
      was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. Jesus
      perfectly revealed and did the will of God, taking upon Himself human
      nature with its demands and necessities and identifying Himself completely
      with mankind yet without sin. He honored the divine law by His personal
      obedience, and in His substitutionary death on the cross He made provision
      for the redemption of men from sin. He was raised from the dead with a
      glorified body and appeared to His disciples as the person who was with
      them before His crucifixion. He ascended into heaven and is now exalted at
      the right hand of God where He is the One Mediator, fully God, fully man,
      in whose Person is effected the reconciliation between God and man. He
      will return in power and glory to judge the world and to consummate His
      redemptive mission. He now dwells in all believers as the living and ever
      present Lord.
  - title: God the Holy Spirit
    description: >-
      The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, fully divine. He inspired holy men
      of old to write the Scriptures. Through illumination He enables men to
      understand truth. He exalts Christ. He convicts men of sin, of
      righteousness, and of judgment. He calls men to the Saviour, and effects
      regeneration. At the moment of regeneration He baptizes every believer
      into the Body of Christ. He cultivates Christian character, comforts
      believers, and bestows the spiritual gifts by which they serve God through
      His church. He seals the believer unto the day of final redemption. His
      presence in the Christian is the guarantee that God will bring the
      believer into the fullness of the stature of Christ. He enlightens and
      empowers the believer and the church in worship, evangelism, and service.
  - title: Man
    description: >-
      Man is the special creation of God, made in His own image. He created them
      male and female as the crowning work of His creation. The gift of gender
      is thus part of the goodness of God’s creation. In the beginning man was
      innocent of sin and was endowed by his Creator with freedom of choice. By
      his free choice man sinned against God and brought sin into the human
      race. Through the temptation of Satan man transgressed the command of God,
      and fell from his original innocence whereby his posterity inherit a
      nature and an environment inclined toward sin. Therefore, as soon as they
      are capable of moral action, they become transgressors and are under
      condemnation. Only the grace of God can bring man into His holy fellowship
      and enable man to fulfill the creative purpose of God. The sacredness of
      human personality is evident in that God created man in His own image, and
      in that Christ died for man; therefore, every person of every race
      possesses full dignity and is worthy of respect and Christian love.
  - title: Salvation
    description: >-
      Salvation involves the redemption of the whole man, and is offered freely
      to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, who by His own blood
      obtained eternal redemption for the believer. In its broadest sense
      salvation includes regeneration, justification, sanctification, and
      glorification. There is no salvation apart from personal faith in Jesus
      Christ as Lord.


      A. Regeneration, or the new birth, is a work of God’s grace whereby
      believers become new creatures in Christ Jesus. It is a change of heart
      wrought by the Holy Spirit through conviction of sin, to which the sinner
      responds in repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
      Repentance and faith are inseparable experiences of grace.


      Repentance is a genuine turning from sin toward God. Faith is the
      acceptance of Jesus Christ and commitment of the entire personality to Him
      as Lord and Saviour.


      B. Justification is God’s gracious and full acquittal upon principles of
      His righteousness of all sinners who repent and believe in Christ.
      Justification brings the believer unto a relationship of peace and favor
      with God.


      C. Sanctification is the experience, beginning in regeneration, by which
      the believer is set apart to God’s purposes, and is enabled to progress
      toward moral and spiritual maturity through the presence and power of the
      Holy Spirit dwelling in him. Growth in grace should continue throughout
      the regenerate person’s life.


      D. Glorification is the culmination of salvation and is the final blessed
      and abiding state of the redeemed.
  - title: God’s Purpose of Grace
    description: >-
      Election is the gracious purpose of God, according to which He
      regenerates, justifies, sanctifies, and glorifies sinners. It is
      consistent with the free agency of man, and comprehends all the means in
      connection with the end. It is the glorious display of God’s sovereign
      goodness, and is infinitely wise, holy, and unchangeable. It excludes
      boasting and promotes humility.


      All true believers endure to the end. Those whom God has accepted in
      Christ, and sanctified by His Spirit, will never fall away from the state
      of grace, but shall persevere to the end. Believers may fall into sin
      through neglect and temptation, whereby they grieve the Spirit, impair
      their graces and comforts, and bring reproach on the cause of Christ and
      temporal judgments on themselves; yet they shall be kept by the power of
      God through faith unto salvation.
  - title: The Church
    description: >-
      A New Testament church of the Lord Jesus Christ is an autonomous local
      congregation of baptized believers, associated by covenant in the faith
      and fellowship of the gospel; observing the two ordinances of Christ,
      governed by His laws, exercising the gifts, rights, and privileges
      invested in them by His Word, and seeking to extend the gospel to the ends
      of the earth. Each congregation operates under the Lordship of Christ
      through democratic processes. In such a congregation each member is
      responsible and accountable to Christ as Lord. Its two scriptural offices
      are that of pastor/elder/overseer and deacon. While both men and women are
      gifted for service in the church, the office of pastor/elder/overseer is
      limited to men as qualified by Scripture.


      The New Testament speaks also of the church as the Body of Christ which
      includes all of the redeemed of all the ages, believers from every tribe,
      and tongue, and people, and nation.
  - title: Baptism and the Lord’s Supper
    description: >-
      Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of
      the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is an act of obedience
      symbolizing the believer’s faith in a crucified, buried, and risen
      Saviour, the believer’s death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the
      resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus. It is a testimony
      to his faith in the final resurrection of the dead. Being a church
      ordinance, it is prerequisite to the privileges of church membership and
      to the Lord’s Supper.


      The Lord’s Supper is a symbolic act of obedience whereby members of the
      church, through partaking of the bread and the fruit of the vine,
      memorialize the death of the Redeemer and anticipate His second coming.
  - title: The Lord's Day
    description: >-
      The first day of the week is the Lord’s Day. It is a Christian institution
      for regular observance. It commemorates the resurrection of Christ from
      the dead and should include exercises of worship and spiritual devotion,
      both public and private. Activities on the Lord’s Day should be
      commensurate with the Christian’s conscience under the Lordship of Jesus
      Christ.
  - title: The Kingdom
    description: >-
      The Kingdom of God includes both His general sovereignty over the universe
      and His particular kingship over men who willfully acknowledge Him as
      King. Particularly the Kingdom is the realm of salvation into which men
      enter by trustful, childlike commitment to Jesus Christ. Christians ought
      to pray and to labor that the Kingdom may come and God’s will be done on
      earth. The full consummation of the Kingdom awaits the return of Jesus
      Christ and the end of this age.
  - title: Last Things
    description: >-
      God, in His own time and in His own way, will bring the world to its
      appropriate end. According to His promise, Jesus Christ will return
      personally and visibly in glory to the earth; the dead will be raised; and
      Christ will judge all men in righteousness. The unrighteous will be
      consigned to Hell, the place of everlasting punishment. The righteous in
      their resurrected and glorified bodies will receive their reward and will
      dwell forever in Heaven with the Lord.
