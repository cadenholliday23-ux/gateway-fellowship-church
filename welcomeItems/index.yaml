      We believe that “faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of
      Christ” (Rom. 10:17). That’s why the focal point of our Sunday gathering
      is hearing the Bible preached.

      On Sundays, we come together to confess our faith and worship the Lord
      together in singing.

  - title: Relational Discipleship
    description: >-
      We take time on Sundays to bring our needs before God, asking Him to stir
      our hearts and renew our minds. We also confess our sins together and ask
      Him to heal us and make us more like Jesus.

    description: >-
      At Gateway Kids, we are passionate about training up the next generation
      to lead, love, and serve Jesus! We strive to come alongside parents to
      help them disciple their children at home while we point them to Jesus
      while they are here.
