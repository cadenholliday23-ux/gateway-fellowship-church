      We believe that “faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of
      Christ” (Rom. 10:17). That’s why the focal point of our Sunday gathering
      is hearing the Bible preached.

      John 17:17 says "Sanctify them in truth, your word is truth." 


      We believe that the main way to grow in the knowledge of the whole council
      of God and become more Christ-like is through the reading, hearing, and
      studying of God's Word. We provide classes for all ages to grow in their
      walk with Christ in community together.

      At Gateway Kids, we are passionate about training up the next generation
      to lead, love, and serve Jesus! We strive to come alongside parents to
      help them disciple their children at home while we point them to Jesus
      while they are here.
