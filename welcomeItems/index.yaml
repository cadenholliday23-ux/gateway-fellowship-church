      We believe that “faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of
      Christ” (Rom. 10:17). That’s why the focal point of our Sunday gathering
      is hearing the Bible preached.

  - title: Praying for Others
    description: >-
      We take time on Sundays to bring our needs before God, asking Him to stir
      our hearts and renew our minds. We also confess our sins together and ask
      Him to heal us and make us more like Jesus.

      We serve others through teams, amplifying our impact and fostering a
      deeper sense of community. By uniting in service, we strengthen our bonds,
      enhance spiritual growth, and meet the needs of those we reach.
